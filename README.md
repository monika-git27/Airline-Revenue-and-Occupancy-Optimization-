# Airline-Revenue-and-Occupancy-Optimization-
## Objective

The goal of this project is to identify opportunities to improve seat occupancy on low-performing flights, helping the airline maximize revenue and overall profitability.

## Project Workflow
1.	Database Connection
* Connected to a travel.sqlite database containing airline operational data.
* Extracted key tables such as aircrafts_data, airports_data, flights, tickets, and bookings.
2.	Data Exploration & Cleaning
*	Inspected datasets for structure, missing values, and inconsistencies.
*	Performed cleaning and preprocessing to prepare data for analysis.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
*	Analyzed flight occupancy rates, revenue trends, and aircraft utilization.
*	Examined relationships between routes, ticket prices, and load factors.
*	Identified underperforming flights with low seat occupancy.
4.	Revenue & Occupancy Insights
*	Evaluated demand patterns across different routes and time periods.
*	Compared aircraft performance and profitability.
*	Highlighted routes where pricing adjustments or promotions could improve load factors.
5.	Visualization
	Built clear visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to track:
*	Occupancy rates by route and aircraft type
*	Revenue contribution by route
*	Seasonal booking patterns
## Key Metrics Analyzed
